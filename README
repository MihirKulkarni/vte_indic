	The main objective of our project was to develop support for Devanagari Script in the
GNOME-terminal. This involved improving the rendering of Devanagari Script which at
present is not proper.

-----------------------ABSTRACT------------------------------

	There are a wide range of users in the computer world. Computer users may or may not
be well versed in English language. So there is need to make available software which have
their GUI and/or instructions in local languages for people to make use of them. This
will not only make it easy for the masses to use software but will also increase computer
literacy in the country. Building new software with interfaces in various local languages
is one of ways to achieve this. But, to understand and modify existing free software
available under GNU GPLv3 and similar licenses and port them into local languages is
perhaps the best and the easiest way. The main advantage of this approach is that we
already have very good quality software available for English which has been tested and
changed to make it the perfect one. So instead of developing a new software right from
scratch it is easier to modify this available software to provide Indic language support.
With this approach in mind, we have selected the most widely used applications in the
GNU/Linux environment which is the GNOME-terminal and vim-editor. There is very
little support for local languages in the GNOME-terminal. Languages like the Devanagari
script (Hindi and Marathi) have almost no support. Our aim is to make the GNOME-
terminal available for people who know the Devanagari script.

	The successful implementation of Devanagari script rendering in GNOME-terminal
will help the developers from other language communities to implement support for their
language also.
