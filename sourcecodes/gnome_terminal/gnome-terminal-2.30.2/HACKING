Discussion about gnome-terminal should happen on desktop-devel-list@gnome.org,
gnome-list@gnome.org, or usability@gnome.org, depending on what sort of
discussion it is. Reporting a bug on http://bugzilla.gnome.org is equally fine.

Remember that the terminal emulation is provided by the VTE widget, maintained
as the 'vte' module on the GNOME SVN. The gnome-terminal product in bugzilla
only covers the menubar, toolbar, and command line options, essentially. VTE,
in turn, is responsible for the actual terminal display.
