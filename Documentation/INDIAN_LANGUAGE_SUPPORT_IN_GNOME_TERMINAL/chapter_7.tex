\chapter{Summary}

We have implemented the Devanagari script rendering in GNOME-terminal with the help of inter cell interaction and using variable rendering widths for characters. This enables proper rendering of Devanagari script. This will guide the other Developers who are working on other languages will be able to render their Complex language script. This will lead to complete complex script support in GNOME-terminal.

We can say that our solution was highly needed by the Indic Language community. We hope that our approach to solve the problem will help other projects as well where rendering is the main issue for providing Indic Language support.

We have released the source code of complete \textit{VTE} with Devanagari support \cite{sourcecode}. Changes to the source code that we have made for Indic support are released under GNU General Public License v3.
